# orbis-2017

The Orbis Challenge is an annual 24h programming challenge, where the goal is to write an AI to play a video game.

This is our (https://github.com/ar0ck and https://github.com/lkunelk) winning implementation of this years game, 'Luminus'.

An explanation of how the game works is in orbis-2017/Eclipse/Orbis Challenge/LUMINIS/Manual/
